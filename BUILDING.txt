BUILDING
--------
The following development systems have been tested.

					Apple PB/Xcode	MPW[4]	Metrowerks CW 7		CW8		MS VS6
					or Makefile
OS X (Mach-O)		YES, PPC+Intel	-		NO[2]				??		-
Carbon CFM (OS X/9)	-				YES[3]	YES[3]				YES		-
OS 9 				-				YES		YES	(code rsrc)		YES		-
Mac 68K 			-				NO		YES	(code rsrc)		YES		-
Windows 			-				-		NO[1]				NO[1]	YES

Respective project files are:
	Xcode/EIComponent.pbproj       (Xcode < 2.4)
	Xcode2.4/EIComponent.xcodeproj (Xcode 2.4)
	EIComponent.make               (MPW)
	EIComponent_cw7.mcp            (CW7)
	EIComponent_cw8.mcp            (CW8)
	EIComponentSample.dsw          (VS6)
	Makefile                       (OS X command line)

To build the component for Windows, the QuickTime Windows SDK is required:
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/QT6SDK_Win.hqx
The VS project expects the SDK to be installed at C:\QTDevWin

For more details, see Apple's ReadMe.rtf in the top level of this
source distribution.

Questions and feedback about building this component to support@telegraphics.com.au

Notes
[1] Can build DLL but adding necessary resources needs Rez and RezWack
    functionality. Project is not complete.

[2] CW8 should be able to build the Mach-O plugin as in v1.3,
    but not tested with 1.4 project.

[3] Carbon CFM versions build OK but do not seem to work yet.
    Project is not complete.

[4] Important note for MPW:
	Before attempting to build in MPW in OS X Classic, you must make sure
	the MacOS file type is 'TEXT' on all source files; in the 'eicomponent'
	trunk directory, execute this command:
		setfile -t TEXT Å.[chr] :Å:Å.[chr] Å.make
	(that wildcard character is option-X).
