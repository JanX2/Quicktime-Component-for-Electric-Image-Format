BUILDING
--------
The following development systems have been tested.
For v1.4, only standalone component has been tested (not linked with application).

					Apple PB/Xcode	MPW		Metrowerks CW 7		CW8		MS VS6

OS X (Mach-O)		YES				-		NO**				??		-
Carbon CFM (OS X/9)	-				YES***	YES***				YES		-
OS 9 				-				YES		YES	(code rsrc)		YES		-
Mac 68K 			-				NO		YES	(code rsrc)		YES		-
Windows 			-				-		NO*					NO*		YES

Project files are Xcode/EIComponent.pbproj, MPW makefile EIComponent.make,
EIComponent_cw7.mcp, EIComponent_cw8.mcp and EIComponentSample.dsw respectively.

To build the component for Windows, the QuickTime Windows SDK is required:
ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/QT6SDK_Win.hqx
The Visual Studio project expects the QTDevWin folder to be installed in root of C:\

For more details, see Apple's ReadMe.rtf in the top level of this source distribution.

MPW NOTE
--------
Before attempting to build in MPW in OS X Classic, you must make sure the MacOS file type is 'TEXT' on all source files; in the 'eicomponent' trunk directory, execute this command:
    setfile -t TEXT Å.[chr] :Å:Å.[chr] Å.make
(that wildcard character is option-X).

Notes
* Can build DLL but adding necessary resources needs Rez and RezWack functionality. Project is not complete.

** CW8 should be able to build the Mach-O plugin as in v1.3, but not tested with 1.4 project.

*** Carbon CFM versions build OK but do not seem to work yet. Project is not complete.
